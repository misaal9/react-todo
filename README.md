Learning React, making a todo app.

# Before running app
I have not added node_modules folder due to size constraints. If you clone this, be sure to run 'npm install' to install all depencies on you local setup.
See tutorial video from link below for more details.

# .gitignore
Entire 'node_modules/' folder has been ignored.
